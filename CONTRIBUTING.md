How to contribute (pull requests, issues, etc.) - 

You can contribute by testing bug fixes, writing code, testing new features, and so much more. THIS INCLUDES THE SMALL THINGS SUCH AS FIXING TYPOS AS WELL. 
To create a PR, make sure the main is up to date and the code follows guidelines. 

Code style or formatting guidelines - Consistency with the rest of the code that is for everyone to read, make sure that it is formatted correctly as well. 


Testing requirements - Writing new tests, improving test coverage, or identifying flaws in existing test cases.


Documentation standards - A clear and descriptive title, something that is easy to read along with the steps being easy to reproduce. 


How to report bugs - Describing problems clearly so they can be reproduced and fixed.


How to propose new features - We love new ideas, but want to make sure proposed features align with DoIt's mission: a lightweight, distraction-free task manager. Create new or add onto exisiting discussions to ee if someone had talked about that same problem. 


Community guidelines and expectations - Everyone is expected to work together to create a working environment.
